    To begin, decide on a score goal (eg: The first one to get to a score of 50 wins).
    
    For each round, you will win points by rolling dice.
    The winner of the round is the one who gets 13 (or slightly less)
    
    If you win the round, then your score will increase by the number of points that you earned.
    If your first roll of two dices is a double (eg: both dice show a three), the your score will be DOUBLE 
    the number of points
    
    If you lose the round, then you don't get any points
    
    If you and the computer tie (eg: you both get a score of 11,
    then you will have 11 points added to your score.
